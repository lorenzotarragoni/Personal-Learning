# Personal-Learning
This repository contains all of my self-taught programming work — projects, exercises, and experiments I've built while learning on my own. Nothing here was done for school; it's purely my personal journey of exploring new ideas, practicing concepts, and improving my skills over time.
Topics in this Repository:
- PHP
- Javascript
